creating new nano file
created new project for costa rican glass analysis for Dr. Molly McCanta
uploaded data sheet and packages for dbplyr and tidyverse
created dataframes for each rock and created column for rock name
joined all dataframes together back into one dataframe that now has a rockname
column and moved that to the first column in df
Added a new branch to work on tas diagram (which I got from a website here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53918035/use-a-diagram-as-background-template-in-a-plot
now I am working on adding data I already created to tas diagram
Many updates made - tas diagram works and alkali plot works but cannot lay
them on top of each other neatly - messy way of each individual included
Also did not commit push there...moved on to creating next plot of SiO2 vs MgO
forgot to save document before pushing, redoing tas info
added plots for SiO2 vs MgO, Al2O3, FeO and TiO2
Saw Drew and made some cosmetic changes to way plots are run.  Added an 
Rmarkdown file so plots will be able to publish for review by Molly

Updated many many things and did not change branches.  Currently on Master and
am going to commit and push and then pull in all branches.  Changes made include
creating rmd file, adding code to calculate Mg# and updating SiO2 to Mg# instead
of MgO.  Also changed legend to better size

Added new data sheet with bulk composition data from first "wheel"
Pulled into new file and used same code to select columns and group
the multiple points into each rock set.

Have no updated to github in quite some time.  However worried that I have no
other copy of this work and want a backup.  So pushing all code into git so
can reboot if lost on computer.
