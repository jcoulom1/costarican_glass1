creating new nano file
created new project for costa rican glass analysis for Dr. Molly McCanta
uploaded data sheet and packages for dbplyr and tidyverse
created dataframes for each rock and created column for rock name
joined all dataframes together back into one dataframe that now has a rockname
column and moved that to the first column in df
Added a new branch to work on tas diagram (which I got from a website here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53918035/use-a-diagram-as-background-template-in-a-plot
now I am working on adding data I already created to tas diagram
Many updates made - tas diagram works and alkali plot works but cannot lay
them on top of each other neatly - messy way of each individual included
Also did not commit push there...moved on to creating next plot of SiO2 vs MgO
forgot to save document before pushing, redoing tas info
added plots for SiO2 vs MgO, Al2O3, FeO and TiO2
